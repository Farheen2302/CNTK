There are several examples for training different networks on image corpora 
in the folder 'ExampleSetups/Image/' including:

* MNIST
* CIFAR-10
* ImageNet
 
For those examples the data has to be downloaded and converted 
(python scripts are provided in the corresponding folder).
These examples also show how to train convolutional neural networks (CNN) with CNTK.

We recommend to start with the MNIST example.
